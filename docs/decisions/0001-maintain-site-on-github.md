# Maintain site on GitHub

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2023-06-05

## Context and Problem Statement

Site continues to be hosted on GitHub. Updates can be more complex and require some level of technical knowledge of the git repo for the site.  Changes are affected by updates to the site "code" and must be redeployed to master be rendered.

## Considered Options

* Keep the site on GitHub. If it ain't broke.
* Move the site to some other location that provides WYSIWYG editing, speeding up the process.
* Have the site redone as a single page business card-like model. It was fun while it lasted!

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "For now, keep the site on GitHub", because there is no budget (time and $) to apply to this, and it remains functional.
